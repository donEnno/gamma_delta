# _Bachelorthesis: Method development for classification ofpatient outcome based on TCR sequences_

## Outline
- I/O: TCR Sequences/Patient healthy or sick or prognosis about medication
- Calculate distance matrices (DM) from raw sequences
- Find cluster of sequences based on the DMs
- Use cluster as input for logistic regression
- Analyze results
-  
## TODO
### Data
- Visualization: Cluster distribution, UMAP representation
- Statistics about data

- Write script for ML Cloud wiht substitution matrices and gap penalties as parameters

### Pipeline
- Clustering: implement kNN graph
- Models: Summarize overlap findings, handle outliers, variable selection (?)

### Thesis
- Write
